1. Clean up the angle/pulsewidth mess:
   - rx emits words in the range of 0..2048
   - pantilt and tracks expect that, and send angles in the range of 0..180 to the servo driver
   - the servo driver expects that, and sends pulsewidths to the PWM chip in the range of 0..4095

   This leads to lots of sloppy map() conversions.

   Unify everybody to use pulsewidths, and the servo driver can simply scale the values 2x.

2. Implement dead zones
